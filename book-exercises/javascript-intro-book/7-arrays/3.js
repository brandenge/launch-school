/*
Let's make the problem a little harder. In this problem, we're again interested in even numbers, but this time the numbers are in nested arrays in a single outer array.

let myArray = [
  [1, 3, 6, 11],
  [4, 2, 4],
  [9, 17, 16, 0],
];
*/

let myArray = [
  [1, 3, 6, 11],
  [4, 2, 4],
  [9, 17, 16, 0],
];

console.log(myArray.flat().filter(elem => elem % 2 === 0));

myArray.flat().forEach(elem => {if (elem % 2 === 0) console.log(elem)});
