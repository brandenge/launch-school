/*
Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

No, it will not produce an error. The for loop syntax will allow you to manually place the increment statement in the for loop wherever you want. So in this case, the increment statement is going inside of the loop block manually. All 3 components/statements of the for loops are optional. The for keyword creates the loop in the following block.

The output will be:

1
2
3
4
5
