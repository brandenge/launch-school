/*
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Exception handling allows a program to be more robust and not be halted by any smaller errors that we may want to handle differently or even allow them to pass by and still continue execution. It gives the programmer more control over what will cause the program to halt execution or not. It uses try/catch statements.
