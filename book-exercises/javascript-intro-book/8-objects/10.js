/*
How many primitive values are there in the following expression? Identify them. How many objects are there in the expression? Identify those objects.

[1, 2, ["a", ["b", false]], null, {}]

Primitive values: 1, 2, "a", "b", false, null. So 6 primitive values.
Objects: the outermost array of everything, the ["a", ["b, false"]] array and then the innermost array of ["b", false]. Plus the empty object {}. So that is 4 objects.
