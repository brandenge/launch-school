/*
Array.prototype.join() expects 0 or 1 argument (a string argument). If you call it with 0 arguments, it will concatenate (join together) the elements of an array into a single string, divided by a comma ',' between them (by default). If given more than 1 argument, it will ignore any additional arguments after the 1st argument.
